All in the zip file, please use the Bybest11s.pt model. This is just a tiny model for which trained just by 400 pictures. So there's some dection errors. 
And that model was trained even by an i5 core laptop without GPU, and after that, old laptop died, RIP.

Make sure files in the same way as shown in the zip. 

Running Environment: Torch 2.2.2 CUDA 11.8, make sure numpy version = 1.26.4, and with ultralytics
